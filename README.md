# BBC Wildlife

BBC Wildlife is a full stack JavaScript application with an Express server and MongoDB database.

## Project Description

BBC Wildlife is an educational app that allows an in-depth, comparative look at various animals with beautiful pictures. With over 90 living species to explore, this app teaches about detailed characteristics. Each animal has its own page that includes photos and information about the species, physical characteristics, diet, habitat, speed, and conservation status. The app is aimed at children between 7 and 12.

While usable in the current state, the app is scalable, and futher functionality will be added in the future.  
Future updates include:  
- adding a quiz so children can test their newly gained knowledge
- adding animal sound examples to make the experience more interactive
