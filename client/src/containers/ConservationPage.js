        <h1> CONSERVATION </h1>
        <h2> OVERVIEW </h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Team AGA have been part of successful wildlife recovery
            stories ranging from southern Africa’s black rhino to bearded dragons
            in the remote regions of Edinburgh since September 2021. And this, in turn, is helping to protect
            rich and varied ecosystems while ensuring people continue to benefit from nature.</p>
       
        <h2>WHY IT MATTERS</h2>
        <p>We protect wildlife for many reasons. It is a source of inspiration. It nurtures a sense
            of wonder. It is integral to the balance of nature. In our work, WWF focuses on saving
            populations of the most ecologically, economically and culturally important species in the wild.
            Ultimately, by protecting species, we save this beautiful, vulnerable and utterly
            irreplaceable planet we call home. </p>

        <h2> WHAT TEAM AGA IS DOING </h2>
        <p> Conserving wildlife is at heart of our mission. We focus on protecting populations of some of
            the world’s most ecologically, economically, and culturally important species—the survival of
            which are threatened by poaching, illegal trade and habitat loss. We use the best science available
            to link on-the-ground work with high-level policy action to create lasting solutions that benefit
            wild animals as well as the people that live alongside them.</p>
        <h2> OUR COLLECTIVE EFFORTS AND OUTCOMES</h2>
        <p>Conserving wildlife is at heart of our mission. We focus on protecting populations of some of the world’s
            most ecologically, economically, and culturally important species—the survival of which are threatened
            by poaching, illegal trade and habitat loss. We use the best science available to link on-the-ground
            work with high-level policy action to create lasting solutions that benefit wild animals as well as
            the people that live alongside them.</p>

        <h2> DOUBLE THE NUMBERS OF TIGERS</h2>
        <p> We aim to double the world’s wild tiger population by 2022 (TX2). We’re working with world leaders
            to take action, focusing conservation efforts in key sites, raising funds to permanently protect
            landscapes, and supporting community-based conservation. Saving tigers is about more than restoring
            a single species. As a large predator, tigers play an important role in maintaining a healthy
            ecosystem. Every time we protect a tiger, we protect around 25,000 acres of forest—forests that
            sustain wildlife and local communities and supply people around the world with clean air, water,
            food, and products.</p>
        <h2> EMPOWER PEOPLE TO PROTECT WILDLIFE</h2>
        <p> Over the last few decades, conservationists have come to understand just how central community
            involvement is to wildlife conservation success—and how important it is for communities to actively
            steward the natural resources around them to improve economic and social well-being. Team Aga's community-based
            conservation work today reflects this fundamental reality. We work across a variety of communities and
            customize our work based on the specific needs and interests of a given place, taking into
            consideration each region’s particular set of conservation assets and challenges.</p>
        <h2> CLOSING ASIA'S IVORY MARKETS</h2>
        <p> Illegal killing of elephants for ivory decimates global populations. Estimates indicate that
            each year poachers slaughter close to 20,000 elephants, mostly for their tusks. Fueling this
             rampant poaching is a steady consumer demand for ivory. Overall, we see demand increasing in
              East Asian and Southeast Asian markets, with the greatest demand in China, Hong Kong, 
              Singapore, and Thailand. We are working to shut down the illegal markets in Thailand, and 
              helped end the legal ivory trade in China. By tackling these markets now as part of a 
              pan-Asian approach, We aim to leverage China’s recent actions to ban the ivory trade to 
              prevent further displacement of the current China ivory trade to nearby countries.</p>
